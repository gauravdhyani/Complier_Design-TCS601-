User: what is JAM
Assistant: **JAM Overview**

JAM (JAM compiler project) is a programming language designed with a simple syntax and structure. It's used for educational purposes, demonstrating the basics of compiler design, lexer/parser implementation, and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) construction.

The provided syntax reference outlines the core elements of the JAM language, including:

* Token separators and comments
* Keywords and identifiers
* Literals (integer, float, string)
* Operators and delimiters
* Data types (Int, Float, Bool, String, Void)
* Complex data structures (arrays, tuples, structs)

The example factorial function showcases a basic JAM program, illustrating the language's syntax and structure.

**Key Features:**

* Simple and readable syntax
* Support for basic data types and control structures
* Arrays, tuples, and structs for complex data representation
* Designed for educational purposes, focusing on compiler design and implementation

How can I assist you further with JAM? Do you have specific questions about the language, lexer/parser design, or AST construction?

##  Introduction  
**JAM (Just Another Micro-Language)** is a lightweight, C-based language and compiler prototype designed to demonstrate the **phases of compiler construction** — lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and execution.  

The project is modular and educational, offering a simplified yet functional compiler-interpreter pipeline that emphasizes **error detection, AST generation, symbol management, and runtime execution**.

##  Project Abstract  
The primary goal of **JAMC** is to build a **functional, modular compiler** that processes a minimal, functional-style programming language.  

Key highlights:  
- Implements **lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, and execution engine**.  
- Supports **basic control structures** (`if`, `else`, loops), **multiple data types** (Int, Float, Bool, String, Void, arrays, structs), and **function declarations**.  
- Demonstrates **variable scope management** with a **symbol table**.  
- Modular design in C  
This project serves as a **learning platform for compiler principles** and a foundation for future extensions (advanced control structures, GUI, improved optimizations).

##  Why JAM  

- **Lightweight Language:** Minimal, easy to grasp for students.  
- **Syntax Inspiration:** Combines **TypeScript-style syntax** with OOP principles.  
- **Functional Programming Support:** Encourages exploration of functional constructs.  
- **Educational Tool:** Teaches compiler phases via live examples and AST visualization.  
- **C-Only Implementation:** Focused learning without distractions from large ecosystems.  
- **Multi-typed yet Minimal Design:** Supports Int, Float, Bool, String, arrays, and structs.

User: hi how does JAM work and it's sytax
Assistant: **Introduction to JAM**

JAM (JAM compiler project) is a programming language designed with a simple syntax and efficient compilation process. Here's an overview of how JAM works and its syntax:

**Syntax Overview**

The JAM syntax is designed to be easy to read and write. It consists of the following elements:

* **Token Separators**: Space, tab (`\t`), newline (`\n`), and carriage return (`\r\n`) are used to separate tokens.
* **Comments**: Single-line comments start with `**`, and multiline comments are enclosed in `*- ... -*`.
* **Keywords**: The following keywords are reserved in JAM:
	+ `fn`: function declaration
	+ `if`, `else`: conditional statements
	+ `var`: variable declaration
	+ `return`: return statement
	+ `import`: import statement
	+ `loop`, `forloop`: loop statements
* **Identifiers**: Identifiers are composed of letters (`A-Za-z`), underscores (`_`), and digits (`0-9`), but must start with a letter or underscore.
* **Literals**: JAM supports the following literals:
	+ Integer: one or more digits (`\d+`)
	+ Float: a decimal number (`\d+\.\d+`)
	+ String: a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (`"..."`) with escape sequences
* **Operators**: JAM supports various operators, including:
	+ Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
	+ Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
	+ Logical: `&&`, `||`, `!`
* **Arrow (Return Type)**: The arrow symbol (`->`) is used to indicate the return type of a function.
* **Delimiters**: JAM uses the following delimiters:
	+ Parentheses: `(`, `)`
	+ Braces: `{`, `}`
	+ Brackets: `[`, `]`
	+ Colon: `:`
	+ Semicolon: `;`
	+ Dot: `.`

**Data Types**

JAM supports the following data types:

* **Int**: a 32-bit integer
* **Float**: a 64-bit floating-point number
* **Bool**: a boolean value (true or false)
* **String**: a sequence of characters
* **Void**: the absence of a value

**Composite Types**

JAM also supports composite types:

* **Arrays**: a collection of values of the same type, declared using the `var` keyword and square brackets (`[]`).
* **Tuples**: a collection of values of different types, declared using the `var` keyword and parentheses (`()`).
* **Structs**: a custom data type composed of multiple fields, declared using the `struct` keyword and braces (`{}`).

**Example**

Here's an example of a JAM function that calculates the factorial of a given integer:
```jam
fn factorial(n: Int) -> Int {
  if n <= 1 {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

var result: Int = factorial(5);
```
This example demonstrates the syntax and structure of a JAM program.

**How JAM Works**

The JAM compiler works as follows:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: The compiler reads the source code and breaks it into individual tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.
2. **Syntax Analysis**: The compiler analyzes the tokens to ensure that they form a valid JAM program, using a parser to check the syntax.
3. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Construction**: The compiler builds an AST representation of the program, which is used for further analysis and optimization.
4. **Semantic Analysis**: The compiler checks the AST for semantic errors, such as type errors or scoping issues.
5. **Code Generation**: The compiler generates machine code from the AST, which can be executed directly by the computer.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any specific questions about JAM or its syntax.
